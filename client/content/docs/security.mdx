# Security & Sandboxing

Run Flare takes security seriously. Every code submission is executed in a strictly isolated environment to ensure the safety of our platform and our users.

## Isolation Environment

We use advanced sandboxing technologies to isolate code execution. This prevents malicious code from accessing sensitive system files, network resources, or other users' data.

## Vulnerability Check Example

To demonstrate our security measures, let's try to access a sensitive system file like `/etc/passwd` using Python.

### Attempting to read /etc/passwd

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>
  <Tab value="Request">
    ```json
    {
      "language_id": 3,
      "source_code": "try:\n    with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:\n        print(f.read())\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'Security Blocked: {e}')"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Response">
    ```json
    {
      "token": "...",
      "status": {
        "id": 3,
        "description": "Accepted"
      },
      "stdout": "Security Blocked: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/passwd'\n",
      "stderr": null
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

As you can see, the sandbox prevents the code from reading the file, raising a `Permission denied` error (or `FileNotFoundError` depending on the specific isolation layer configuration).

## Network Isolation

By default, network access is disabled for all submissions. Any attempt to make external network requests will fail.

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>
  <Tab value="Request">
    ```json
    {
      "language_id": 3,
      "source_code": "import urllib.request\ntry:\n    urllib.request.urlopen('https://google.com')\n    print('Connected')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'Network Blocked: {e}')"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Response">
    ```json
    {
      "token": "...",
      "status": {
        "id": 3,
        "description": "Accepted"
      },
      "stdout": "Network Blocked: <urlopen error [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution>\n",
      "stderr": null
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
